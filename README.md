# Momentum-fake
Layout mimincing the momentum chrome extension. Doesn't have any actual code related to chrome extension set up, just the front-end part.

It has a clock that updates as time passes. A quote and backgournd img also updates each day. However, the quote api only allows 
10 requests every hour. 

The weather part is not working for now. I cannot connect to the OpenWeather api for some reason.
